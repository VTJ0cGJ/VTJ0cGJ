- Hello, this is my second (now main) github account, as my original was in a data leak.
- I am a solo, freelance Rust developer, along with proficencies in C# & Python.
- I am looking for a repository to work on currently, any suggestions will be welcome.
- I have interests in networking (but not web), desktop software development & anything that means I don't have to make a gui.
- I use Windows with Arch Linux on WSL.
- I like open source.
- contact me at: vtj0cgj@outlook.com.
